1. SPECIAL EDITOR CONTROLS
--------------------------

a. For the most part, the editor can be learned while using it.

   - All the controls and functionality are provided in the info pane at the
     bottom of the editor.

   - Mouse over something to learn more, including controls associated with it.

b. Some things that can't be learned while using it:

   - Hit F1 to open the levels folder with your file manager.

   - Hit Ctrl-enter to export all the levels to a .h file which can replace the
     one contained in the Glove source code. Recompile Glove to play your maps!

   - The game code may have to be modified slightly if a number of levels other
     than 30 will be used.

	
2. EDITOR LIMITATIONS
---------------------

a. Any level that is ready to be exported to game code MUST contain the maximum
   number of each element type.

   - Mouse over an element type to view how many of it currently exist.
   
   - This is a restriction of the level format.

   - It won't display any error message. I made this level editor one night
     when working on this game, please take it for what is is ;)
	 
b. The anchor of objects is the top-left corner.

   - You have to mouse over the top-left corner of objects to manipulate them.
